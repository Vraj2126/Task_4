-> This task simulates an end-to-end IoT communication system using the MQTT protocol in Python. 

-> A local Mosquitto broker is used to transmit real-time temperature and humidity data from a publisher to a subscriber. 

-> The subscriber receives the data, logs it to a CSV file with timestamps, and visualizes it live using Matplotlib with the ggplot style. 

-> Real-time plotting updates every second, displaying temperature and humidity trends clearly. 

-> The setup helps understand how real-world IoT systems handle data publishing, subscribing, logging, and visualization.
